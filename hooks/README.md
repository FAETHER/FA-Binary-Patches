This folder contains the hooks that overwrite at specific offset.

Files with .cpp are compiled by g++. Files with .jh are just data interpreted,

originally created by asmjit assembler. 

Files with any other extensions are considered to be not used by default, and its up to the

user to decide if they are wanted.
